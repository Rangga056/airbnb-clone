## Installation and Setup Instructions

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Reflection

- **Context:** This project marks a pivotal part of my ongoing journey in web development, undertaken during my academic tenure at Universitas Nasional.

- **Objective:** The primary aim was to develop an application facilitating streamlined event management, empowering users to effortlessly create and participate in diverse events.

- **Challenges:** Effectively managing event details and integrating ticket purchasing functionality posed significant hurdles. Extensive research was undertaken to devise robust and efficient solutions.

- **Unexpected Obstacles:** Adapting the project to seamlessly incorporate ticket purchasing and ensuring an intuitive user experience presented unforeseen challenges, requiring agile problem-solving.

- **Tooling:** For this project, I utilized a powerful tech stack. Next.js 14 provided enhanced performance and TypeScript support, while Tailwind CSS facilitated a utility-first approach to styling. For the backend, I leveraged Supabase, which utilizes PostgreSQL as the database, offering scalability and robustness. Prisma served as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), enabling seamless interaction with the database. Deployment was streamlined with Vercel, Shadcn enriched the project with beautiful and accessible components. User authentication was handled by Kinde, ensuring a secure and seamless authentication process.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, Next JS 14, Typescript, MongoDB, Clerk, Shadcn, Stripe and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX/TSX, and TailwindCSS.
